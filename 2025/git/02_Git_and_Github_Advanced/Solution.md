💡 What is "Stash" in Git?

Imagine you're working on a document, but halfway through, you suddenly need to switch and work on something else. You’re not ready to save your changes permanently yet, but you don’t want to lose them either.

In Git, **"stashing"** is like putting your current work into a **temporary drawer**. You’re not throwing it away, and you’re not saving it to the final version. You're just **keeping it safe to finish later**.

🗂️ Here's how it works:

* You **stash** your changes: This means you put them away temporarily.
* You switch to something else (maybe fix something urgent).
* When you're ready, you **"pop" the stash**: This means you take your work back out of the drawer and continue where you left off.

 🎯 Why use Git Stash?

Because sometimes:

* You’re in the middle of something...
* But you need to pause and do something else urgently...
* And you don’t want to lose your current work or save it permanently yet.

Git Stash is like a **"pause and save for later"** button.
